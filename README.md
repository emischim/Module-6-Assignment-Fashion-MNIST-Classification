# Fashion MNIST Classification using CNN

This project involves classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using a CNN implemented in both Python and R.

## Python Instructions:
1. Install dependencies: `tensorflow`, `keras`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
2. Run the `cnn_fashion_mnist.py` file.
3. The model will be trained, and predictions will be shown for two images.

## R Instructions:
1. Install dependencies:  `tensorflow`, `keras`, `reticulate`
2. Run the `cnn_fashion_mnist.R` file.
3. The model will be trained, and predictions will be shown for two images.

## Structure:
- `cnn_fashion_mnist.py`: Python code for CNN classification.
- `cnn_fashion_mnist.R`: R code for CNN classification.
- `README.md`: This file containing instructions.
